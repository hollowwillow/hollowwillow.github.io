        <h2>The History of Egg Pie</h2>
                    <p>       Egg pie <b><u>originated in the Philippines</u></b>. During the Middle Ages, the first custard pies (in the modern sense of the term) began to appear.
                         Egg pies are commonly sold in bakeries in the Philippines. For years, egg pies have been enjoyed by both <i>Pilipinos</i> and other nationalities across the world.

         <h2>Steps for Egg Pie</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, add all-purpose flour, white sugar, salted butter, and egg yolks.</li>
            <li>Mix with hands until crumbly. <u><b><em>DO NOT OVERMIX!!!</em></b></u> </li>
            <li>While mixing with hands, gradually pour in ice cold water. 
                <ul>
                    <li>If the dough is very sticky, feel free to add a little more all-purpose flour</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Knead until it becomes a smooth dough</li>
            <li>Evenly divide the dough into two balls </li>
            <li>Roll dough on parchment paper <u>(or wax paper)</u> that has a little bit of flour on it</li>
            <li>Gradually roll the dough into an even circle </li>
            <li>Make sure that the size of the dough is slightly bigger than your pie plate</li>
            <li>Next, transfer the flat dough onto your pie plate and gently push the dough into shape</li>
            <li>Get a pair of scissors and cut off the excess dough and fold in the dough inwards toward the pie plate
                <ul>
                    <li>For shape, pinch the edges of the dough to create a distinct pie shape</li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>Repeat the same process for the other dough ball and place it in another pie plate</li>
            <li>Set both pie plates aside and get another bowl to start on the filling!</li>
            <li>Add 6 whole eggs, 6 egg yolks, and two cans of condensed milk in the bowl.</li>
            <li>
                Next, add 2 cups of evaporated milk and 1-2 tablespoons of vanilla extract
                <ul>
                    <li>You don't need to use high quality vanilla extract for this recipe!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Gradually whisk the mixture until smooth</li>
            <li>
                In another bowl, add your egg whites and beat it until it's fully white and bubbly
                <ul>
                    <li>If you can, use an electic mixer with a wire whisk attachment on high speed because whisking manually will take longer.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add the egg white mixture to the other bowl with condensed milk mixure and whisk until combined. </li>
            <li>To ensure a smooth, creamy, egg pie, strain the filling mixure into another bowl <em>(or to save yourself from dishes, straight into the pie plates)</em></li>
            <li>Evenly distribute the strained filling mixure into the two pie plates.</li>
            <li>In a tiny bowl, crack an egg and mix it with a splash of milk to make an egg wash (This will make the crust a nice golden brown color)</li>
            <li>Start brushing the egg wash onto the crust of the pie dough</li>
            <li>Finally, place the pies in a 350°F preheated oven for about an hour</li>
            <li>After an hour, take the pies out and enjoy!</li>
         </ol>
